**ML Analysis**

Analyzing different learning algorithms on different datasets.

Two jupyter notebooks and multiple CSV files are attached. Make sure these files stay within the same directory. 

To run both notebooks, jupyter-notebook must be install as well as numpy, scipy, pandas, and matplotlib. If an Anaconda distribution is installed, that would also be sufficient. 

Each notebook pertains to each dataset, as seen in the respective titles. 

A full analysis is available in the pdf file attached.
